# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1







## Loading and preprocessing the data
1. Load the data

The raw file is in CSV format, so `read.csv` function will be used for loading the data.

```r
act <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

2. Preprocess the data

The data has been in long-format, so I think that it isn't needed to preprocess the data any more.


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
